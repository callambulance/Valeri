# Valeri
Hi!
My name is Valeri and I just finished my 1-year fullstack developer course at CodeCool.

I prefer to work as a backend developer and I have experience with Python, Flask (and a little bit Django) and Java, Sptring Boot.


Some team projects I had worked on during my course: 

Console games in Python: Hangman, Tic-Tac-Toe, Battleship;
Python & Flask apps: crowdsourced Q&A site - like Stack Overflow, kanban desk app - similar to Trello;
Java apps: Dungeon Crawl game, online eCommerce web-application (grocery shop);
Spring Boot and Angular: IMom - application to help manage pregnancy and motherhood;


Here is a list of tools and technologies that I use:

[Python,  Flask,  Java,  Spring,  Hibernate,  PostgreSQL,  Maven,  Servlets,  Angular,  JavaScript,  AJAX,  GIT,  JSON,  HTML,  Clean coding]
