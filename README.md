Hi!

My name is Valeri and I've just finished my 1-year fullstack developer course at CodeCool.

I prefer to work as a backend developer and I have experience with Java, Spring Boot and Python, Flask (also a little bit with Django).


Some team projects I had worked on during my course: 

 - Console games in Python: Hangman, Tic-Tac-Toe, Battleship;
 - Python & Flask apps: crowdsourced Q&A site - like Stack Overflow, kanban desk app - similar to Trello;
 - Java apps: Dungeon Crawl game, online eCommerce web-application (grocery shop);
 - Spring Boot and Angular: IMom - application to help manage pregnancy and motherhood;


And here is a list of tools and technologies that I use:

[Java,  Spring,  Maven,  Servlets, Hibernate, PostgreSQL,  Python,  Flask,  Angular,  JavaScript,  AJAX,  HTML,  Clean coding]
